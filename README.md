1. [Mining the Unknown: Assigning Function to Noncoding Single Nucleotide Polymorphism](https://www.cell.com/trends/genetics/fulltext/S0168-9525(16)30147-0) 

This paper reviewed the bioinformatics tools developed so far (2017) to understand the function of non-coding SNPs. These tools can be categorized into three types: functional annotations, conservation, and machine learning tools which incorporate multiple lines of evidence including functional annotations and conservation. 

The functional annotation tools used high-throughput assays to predict the possible regulatory function in the non-coding sequence such as DNase-seq, ATAC-seq, and eQTL but the availability of the data is restricted by whether the cell-type-specific interactions could be detected by the specific technology.

The drawbacks of machine learning methods include susceptibility to bias in the training data set and lack of gold-standard training set. 

Incorporation of 3D structural data (e.g. Chromosome conformation capture (3C), Chromosome conformation capture-on-chip (4C) and Chromosome conformation capture carbon copy (5C)) will improve our ability to assign regulatory SNPs to their target genes.
